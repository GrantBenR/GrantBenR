## Hi, this is the main account of Grant Rynders, a Junior in Computer Science at Wright State University.
### I love software development of all kinds and am currently pursuing a hobby reverse engineering project!

# Highlights:
## <a href="https://github.com/GrantBenR/YsViDecomp">Ys Vi The Ark of Napishtim Decompilation</a>
<div style="width:100%; display:inline-block;"><img style="width:300px; display:block; margin:auto;" alt="Thumbnail of Ys Vi The Ark of Napishtim with the full logo, Adol, Olha, and the black ark in the background" src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/312540/capsule_616x353.jpg?t=1732664294"></img></div>

A repository for my Ghidra reverse engineering endeavour into the DX8 English Steam release of <i>Ys Vi</i>. As of January 2025, I have achieved full function classification, and am working to make modifications to the game and to make function definitions and labels more detailed and complete.

## <a href="https://github.com/GrantBenR/2025Hackathon">2025 Hackathon - Spotify Discord Bot</a>
<a href="https://github.com/nfairweather93"> Our </a> submission for the Wright State 2025 Hackathon: Jukebox Jerk. It is a spotify bot that I programmed in Java that manages authentication and user data from the Spotify API for the purpose of making fun of users. Though perhaps a problem better suited for Python, we came out with a commendable, functional bot.

## <a href="https://github.com/GrantBenR/ITSC-2024-Github-Extension-Project">Github Timer Extension Project</a>
A project I led creating timer extension for Github issues that allows users to manage the amount of time spent on a given issue through a built in timer. Timer data will be written to a unique log comment for the user, and recorded in a sqlite or postgres database on our node.js server. The data is visualized via chart.js and pug pages on the server.
